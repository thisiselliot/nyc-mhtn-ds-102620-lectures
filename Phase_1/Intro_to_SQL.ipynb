    "### What is a Relational Database? \n",
    "- An relational database management system (RDBMS) is a type of DBMS with a row-based table structure that connects related data elements and includes functions that maintain the security, accuracy, integrity and consistency of the data.\n",
    "- The most basic RDBMS functions are related to create, read, update and delete operations, collectively known as CRUD."

    "### SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQLite is a popular open source SQL database. \n",
    "- It can store an entire database in a single file.\n",
    "- It is 'lite' because it is not server based.\n",
    "- Does not have many features of server-based RDBMS like users and permissions.\n",
    "- Great to get up and running quick, not good for complex projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "- MySQL is the most popular open source SQL database. \n",
    "- It is typically used for web application development, and often accessed using PHP. \n",
    "- It is easy to use, inexpensive, reliable and has a large community of developers who can help answer questions.\n",
    "- Open source development has lagged since Oracle has taken control of MySQL.\n",
    "- Has been known to suffer from poor performance when scaling, \n",
    "- Does not include some advanced features that developers may be used to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "- PostgreSQL is an open-source SQL database that is not controlled by any corporation.\n",
    "- PostgreSQL shares many of the same advantages of MySQL.\n",
    "- It is slower in performance than other databases such as MySQL\n",
    "- Harder to come by hosts or service providers that offer managed PostgreSQL instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Oracle DB\n",
    "\n",
    "- Owned by Oracle Corporation, and the code is not open sourced. \n",
    "- Oracle DB is for large applications, particularly in the banking industry. \n",
    "- The main disadvantage of using Oracle is that it is not free.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "- Microsoft owns SQL Server. \n",
    "- Large enterprise applications mostly use SQL Server.\n",
    "- Microsoft offers a free entry-level version called Express but can become very expensive as you scale your application. "

    "- Tables\n",

    "- Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tables\n",
    "Tables are used to store data within the database.  They are its main component and without them, the database would serve little purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Tables can have hundreds, thousands, sometimes even millions of rows of data. These rows are often called **records**.\n",
    "- The consists of **columns** of data that are labeled with a descriptive name (say, age for example) and have a specific data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexes\n",
    "Indexes are used to make data retrieval faster. Rather than having to scan an entire table for data, an index allows the database to, essentially, directly retrieve the data being asked of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes are primariy created using using a **Primary Key**.\n",
    "A primary key’s main features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It must contain a unique value for each row of data.\n",
    "- It cannot contain null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question for You**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were a tax accountant and you wanted to create a database of your clients, which of the following columns who be a good choice for your primary key?\n",
    "\n",
    "- First Name\n",
    "- Last Name\n",
    "- Email Address\n",
    "- SSN\n",
    "- Phone Number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers are special instructions that are executed when important events, such as inserting or updating records in a table happen. The most common triggers are Insert, Update, and Delete triggers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two items define a trigger on a table: a stored procedure and an event, such as inserting a record that invokes its execution."
